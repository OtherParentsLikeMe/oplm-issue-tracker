# OPLM.com Website Feedback & Issue Tracking

This repository is used to track **bugs, issues, and feature requests** for the **oplm.com** website.

There is no application code here. Think of this repo as a public workbench where problems are documented, ideas are proposed, and improvements are discussed.

## What this repository is for

- Reporting website bugs or broken functionality  
- Requesting new features or improvements  
- Tracking known issues and planned work  
- Providing feedback on usability, performance, or content  

## What this repository is not for

- User support or account issues  
- Membership, billing, or payment questions  
- Sensitive or private information  

For support-related questions, please use the official OPLM contact channels on **oplm.com** instead of GitHub.

## How to submit an issue

1. Click **Issues** → **New Issue**
2. Choose the issue type that best fits your request (bug report or feature request)
3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - What you were trying to do  
   - What happened  
   - What you expected to happen  
   - Links, screenshots, or steps to reproduce (if applicable)

Clear issues are faster to fix. Vague issues tend to evolve slowly.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. Please explain:
- The problem you’re trying to solve  
- Who benefits from the change  
- Any ideas you have for how it might work  

Not every idea will be implemented, but every idea will be considered.

## Issue lifecycle

Issues may be:
- Labeled for triage or discussion  
- Linked to other related issues  
- Closed once resolved, declined, or superseded  

Closed does not mean ignored—it usually means a decision was made.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful. Assume good intent.  
This project exists to improve the OPLM community experience.
